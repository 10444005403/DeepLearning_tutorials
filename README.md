# DeepLearning tutorials with Tensorflow
The deeplearning algorithms are carefully implemented by [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  
The deeplearning algorithms includes (now):
- Logistic Regression  [logisticRegression.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/logisticRegression.py)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) [mlp.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/mlp.py)
- Convolution Neural Network (CNN) [cnn.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/cnn.py)
- Denoising Aotoencoder (DA) [da.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/da.py)
- Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) [sda.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/sdan.py)
- Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) [rbm.py](https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials/blob/master/models/rbm.py)

Note: the project aims at imitating the well-implemented algorithms in [Deep Learning Tutorials](http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/) (coded by [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/index.html)).
