# DeepLearning_tutorials
The deeplearning algorithms implemented by tensorflow  
The deeplearning algorithms includes (now):
- Logistic Regression
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
- Denoising Aotoencoder (DA)
- Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA)

Note: the codes are mostly similar to the [Deep Learning Tutorials](http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/)
